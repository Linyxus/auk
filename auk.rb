# Homebrew formula for auk. Auto-updated by release.sh on each release — the
# version, url, and sha256 lines below are rewritten there, so edit the rest of
# the file (desc/test/etc.) by hand but leave those three to the release script.

# Install by tapping this repo:
#   brew tap linyxus/auk https://github.com/Linyxus/auk
#   brew trust linyxus/auk          # required: custom-remote taps must be trusted
